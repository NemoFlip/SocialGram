I'd like to introduce my new project!
App which allows to share pictures around the world!
In this project i used many @escaping closures to handle data from firebase. Stack: Firebase, SwiftUI, UserDefaults, MVVM.
User authenticates with google account, he can upload one or multiple photos per post. He also can add description and other users can drop a comment under this post.
Complete like system for post and comments. Options to delete post, comment and also user. From firebase i used storage, authentication, firestore.
